            I’ve recently completed my first app designed in React — a major milestone in my long-standing journey into web development. While I’ve been designing and building for the web for over 20 years, this project marked the first time I applied modern frameworks and component-based architecture to build something from scratch. It confirmed my passion for frontend development and my readiness to pursue it professionally. I’m excited to be part of teams where I can contribute visually engaging, technically sound experiences while continuing to grow my skills.<br /><br />
            
            I’m a creative, hands-on professional with over a decade of experience spanning the beer industry, events, marketing, design, and web development. I bring a unique blend of commercial acumen, team leadership, and technical expertise — with a passion for delivering engaging experiences, whether in-person or online.<br /><br />

            My career began in the beer industry, where I developed a deep understanding of craft beer, distribution, and customer experience. As the founder of Love Beer, I built a successful events-driven business delivering high-end draft beer installations for offices and private clients. This included working with global brands like Meta and Google, managing everything from product sourcing to customer experience — and often acting as both supplier and consultant. I was responsible for every aspect of operations, combining my knowledge of hospitality with strategic business leadership.<br /><br />

            In parallel, I led event teams across major activations and private functions. I pride myself on being a reliable, motivating team leader who balances energy and professionalism. My experience includes managing high-pressure live events, coordinating with suppliers and clients, and ensuring flawless delivery — even when the variables are constantly shifting.<br /><br />

            My design journey started in Photoshop at age 14 and led me to study Graphic Design at university. Over the years, I honed these skills into practical marketing and branding knowledge, developing countless creative assets, from social media graphics to full website designs. I’m proficient in Adobe Creative Suite and experienced in turning ideas into polished deliverables.<br /><br />

            That design interest evolved into a love for web development. After years of self-taught coding and running my own WordPress e-commerce site, I recently completed a BCS Level 4 Full Stack Development qualification to formalise and modernise my skill set. I’m now proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and increasingly confident with React, Node.js, and Python. I’m passionate about front-end development — where visual design meets user experience — and I bring an SEO- and accessibility-conscious mindset to every build.<br /><br />

            Marketing has been a constant throughout my career. I’ve planned and executed multi-channel digital campaigns, managed PPC and email strategy, and built a brand that ranked at the top of organic search results. I understand how to combine creative content with analytical thinking to drive growth, and I thrive on finding practical solutions that connect brands with audiences.<br /><br />

            Now, I’m focused on transitioning fully into the digital space. I’m looking for a collaborative, forward-thinking team where I can apply my unique mix of experience — and continue learning, building, and creating with purpose.<br /><br />
